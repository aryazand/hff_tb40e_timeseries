    \ paired-end PRO-Seq was performed on human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) infected\
    \ with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) for 4 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h using\
    \ the TB40/e strain. Cells were treated with 1\xB5M flavopiridol 1 hour prior\
    \ to isolation. Additionally, PRO-Cap was performed on untreated HFFs after 72\
    \ h of infection. Each experiment was performed with adapters containing 8 nt\
    \ of random sequence flanking both ends (16 total bases of randomness) to enable\
    \ deduplication."
